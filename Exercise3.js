// Sorry, i have worked all evening to solve these problems but decided to call it quits at 21:15.
// I will continue tomorrow, because i feel like the cirriculum provided does not provide what i need to solve this.
// And i do currently not have the energy anymore to keep looking after all day continuous work since 9. (12! hours).
